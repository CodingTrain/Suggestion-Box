**If you are looking for programming help,** then you'll probably have better luck at on [The Coding Train's Discord](https://discord.gg/hPuGy2g). Which has a number of help channels. You can also checkout [The Processing Foundation's Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/) which is a great place to ask about processing and p5.js. And of course [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is great for obscure topics because the user base is so big.
